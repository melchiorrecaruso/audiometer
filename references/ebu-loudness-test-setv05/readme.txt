- The bitdepth is indicated at the end of each filename.
- Please note there are two versions of seq-3341-6:
-- seq-3341-6-5channels-16bit.wav is the original 5.0 version (channel order: L, R, C, LS, RS), but uses the WAVE_FORMAT_PCM flag.
-- seq-3341-6-6channels-WAVEEX-16bit.wav is the same as above, but with a silent .1 channel and using the WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE flag.
- Files seq-3341-3..., seq-3341-4..., and seq-3341-5... differ from v01 of this test set. They were first described in the August 2011 publication of EBU Tech 3341 and to prevent confusion, they are labeled 'v02'.
